    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Before</h3>

<p>So with all the best intentions in the world it turns out that we haven&rsquo;t taken the best before photos. I blame it on a combination of the excitement of getting the keys, it being dark when we first walked through and only having an iPhone to take photos with. Anyway, you can still get some ideas as to the challeneges that face us over the coming months, or should that be years?!</p>

<h1><strong>Floor Plan</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/Floorplan.JPG" title="Floor Plan" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>So above is the floor plan for our new house. The problem with having plenty of space / rooms in a situation like this is it means that there is plenty to actually have to put right in the first place. We definitely went into this with the long-term in mind; let&rsquo;s just hope that the long-term doesn&rsquo;t take that long to become the reality.</p>

<p><strong>Hallway</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_01.JPG" title="Into the hallway" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_02.JPG" title="The porch" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This is the first thing you see when you open the front door, it&rsquo;s a lovely shade of baby pink isn&rsquo;t it?! Not only is the colour not to our taste but the wallpaper is actually woodchip too. That&rsquo;s going to be fun to remove. On the plus side the original entrance porch tiles are there and are all still in tact; albeit in need of a good cleaning up.</p>

<p><strong>Sitting Room</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_03.JPG" title="Sitting room - fireplace" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_04.JPG" title="Sitting room - window bay" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The sitting room is a great size and proportion with some fantastic original wooden sash windows in the bay. It also comes with a few not so welcome features: the awful 1970&rsquo;s (at a guess) fireplace, the damp under the windows and the surface-mount plug socket. The sockets are a theme throughout the house, but sometimes it can be difficult to spot them as some rooms only have a single socket!</p>

<p><strong>Dining Room</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_05.JPG" title="Dining room 1" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_06.JPG" title="Dining room 2" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_07.JPG" title="Dining room 3" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This is probably the most colourful room in the house. Not by design, but more because the previous owners clearly never felt the need to move furniture when they decided to redecorate. It doesn&rsquo;t come across in the pictures but there are actually four different colours on the walls in here. The &ldquo;top colour&rdquo; is meant to be the green, but it&rsquo;s not just any green, it&rsquo;s a green that would be best described as fire exit green. Lovely!</p>

<p>Again there&rsquo;s more damp to contend with in this room and a lot of built-in shelving that won&rsquo;t be lasting very long at all.</p>

<p><strong>Rear Reception Room</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_08.JPG" title="Rear reception" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_09.JPG" title="Under the stairs" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>More pink, more surface-mount sockets and this time there&rsquo;s a back boiler and gas fireplace to add to the mix. It does have this cute (perhaps not?) under stairs storage cupboard that may come in handy when the wife won&rsquo;t leave me alone.</p>

<p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_10.JPG" title="Kitchen left" alt="alt text" />
<img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_11.JPG" title="Kitchen right" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Somebody once said something about having enough room to swing a cat. I don&rsquo;t think either of ours would appreciate it if I tried in here as they would definitely hit the cupboards and wall on both sides. Small would be the understatement of the century!</p>

<p><strong>Garden Room / WC</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://allenar.github.com/images/IMG_11a.JPG" title="Garden room" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>This is the only photo we appear to have taken of the garden room which is a shame as it&rsquo;s the only room, along with the downstairs WC, that have actually seen any redecorating in what feels like the last 50 years. It&rsquo;s just a shame that we haven&rsquo;t been given a key to the door.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it for the first instalment of the new house reveal. The upstairs and garden will be featured in the next episode; we don&rsquo;t want to give you too much of a good thing in one go now do we??</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s your favourite feature? What would you tackle first? Is there anything that you think might actually survive through to project completion?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>We have the keys!!!</h3>

<p>I know I already said that but it felt so big that I had to say it twice.</p>

<p>After many months of backwards and forwards between the mortgage company and solicitors things have finally all come together. We exchanged on Monday and completed this morning so I was able to drop into the estate agents and pick up the keys this evening.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s going to be plenty to keep us busy over the coming months and years but to begin with I&rsquo;m going to go around the house and take some &ldquo;before&rdquo; photos so that when things start to get draining we can look back and see just how far we&rsquo;ve come!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Offer Accepted</h3>

<p>So the offer we put in on the house was accepted and we are going through the mountains of paperwork now. Fingers crossed that in the next few weeks we will get hold of the keys and this will become our new house. I say house rather than home because there is so much that we are going to need to do with it that I don&rsquo;t think we will really consider it our home for quite some time!</p>
