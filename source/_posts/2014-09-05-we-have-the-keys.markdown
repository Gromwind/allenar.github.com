### We have the keys!!!

I know I already said that but it felt so big that I had to say it twice.

After many months of backwards and forwards between the mortgage company and solicitors things have finally all come together. We exchanged on Monday and completed this morning so I was able to drop into the estate agents and pick up the keys this evening.

There's going to be plenty to keep us busy over the coming months and years but to begin with I'm going to go around the house and take some "before" photos so that when things start to get draining we can look back and see just how far we've come!
