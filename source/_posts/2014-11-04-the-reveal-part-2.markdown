# Upstairs

Three weeks ago I gave you the downstairs reveal and since then I've been farily busy in at the house getting on with things but I thought it finally time I get on and do the upstairs and garden reveal.


## **Floor Plan**

For those of you with a poor memory or who have been lucky enough to stumble across this blog for the first time, the above picture shows the layout for our house.

## **Master Bedroom**

In terms of colour, this is the room that has been painted in the most neutral colour of all rooms in the house. It's actually in a pretty good condition decor-wise the only real issue with this room, like the rest of the house, is that the window boxes and windows themselves just don't fit the holes.
So although it might look pretty good, it is definitely going to be very cold as we move into the Winter. Also, like in a lot of houses of this age the fireplace has been boarded up. Fingers crossed that when we get around to opening it up that the original is just sat behind there waiting for us.

## **Bedroom 2**

Another fairly reasonable room in terms of decor. The fireplace is in tact and the colours aren't overly offensive, so long as you can look past the mountain of blu-tac attached to the wall when it was clearly some sort of poster montage! In the corner you can see again where they have failed to decorate behind furniture and also where tracking has been used to put up shelves. Delightful.

## **Bedroom 3**

More signs of the green colour in this room. Not only that, but you can see the third and finally radiator in the entire house... it's just a shame that this one isn't actually plumbed in! On the plus side there's another original fireplace and just plenty of potential.

## **Bathroom**

Functional. That's about the only way I can describe this room without being rude.

The colour isn't great, the suite is worse and it doesn't come out in the picture very well but if you are lying in the bath with your head at the tap end you actually have the airing cupboard built over your head. Combine that with the header tank offshot just sat on a couple of brackets I'd be very nervous about actually using this bath for any period of time.

## **Garden**

And finally here are a couple of shots of the garden. It's really hard to tell from the pictures but there is actually quite a bit of space out there. If we look over into the neighbours we can see just how much because the dimensions are almost identical it's just a combination of the overgrown borders and the bush at the end of the garden. You may be saying to yourself "bush", and yes it is actually a bush.
That Laurel bush may be about 30ft tall and have a diameter of more than our garden but yes it is actually just a bush. I'm not looking forward to having to remove that, especially as we have no rear / side access so disposal is going to be a challenge.

So that's it, you've seen everything our house has to offer. Where would you start? How long do you think it's going to be before we can comfortably move in?
