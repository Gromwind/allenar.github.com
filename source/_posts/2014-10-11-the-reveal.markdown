### Before

So with all the best intentions in the world it turns out that we haven’t taken the best “before” photos in the world. I blame it on a combination of the excitement of getting the keys, it being dark when we did our first walk through and only having an iPhone to take photos with. Anyway, you can still get some idea as to the challenge that faces us, or more accurately me, over the coming months / years.

**Floor Plan**

So above is the floor plan for our new house. The problem with having plenty of space / rooms in a situation like this is it means that there is plenty to actually have to put right in the first place. We definitely went into this with the long-term in mind; let’s just hope that the long-term doesn’t take that long to become a reality.

**Hallway**

This is the first thing you see when you open the front door, it’s a lovely shade of baby pink isn’t it?! Not only is the colour not to our taste but the wallpaper is actually woodchip too, that’s going to be fun to remove. On the plus side the original entrance porch tiles are there are all still in tack; albeit in need of a good cleaning up.

**Sitting Room**

The sitting room is a great size and proportion with some fantastic original wooden sash windows in the bay. It also comes with a few not so welcome features, note the awful 1970’s (at a guess) fireplace that’s been built in with a plug in fireplace in front, the damp under the bay window and the surface-mount plug socket. Those are a theme throughout the house if you can spot them, but it’s a tricky task in some rooms as there is only one single socket!

**Dining Room**

This is probably the most colourful room in the house. Not by design, but more because the previous owners never felt the need to move any furniture when they decided to redecorate. It doesn’t come across in the pictures but there are actually four different colours on the walls here; being a combination of wallpaper and paint. The final colour that the room is meant to be is green, but not just any green, a green that would be best described as “fire exit green”. Lovely!
Again there’s more damp to contend with in this room and a lot of built-in shelving that won’t be lasting very long at all.

**Rear Reception Room**

More pink, more surface mount sockets and this time there’s a back boiler and gas fireplace to add to the mix. It doesn’t have this cute (perhaps not?) under stairs storage cupboard that may come in handy when the wife won’t leave me alone.

**Kitchen**

Somebody once said something about having enough room to swing a cat. I don’t think either of ours would appreciate it if I tried in here as they would definitely hit the cupboards and wall on both sides in here. Small would be the understatement of the century!

**Garden Room / WC**

This is the only photo we appear to have taken of the garden room which is a shame as it’s the only room, along with the downstairs WC, that have actually seen any redecorating in what feels like the last 50 years. It’s just a shame that we haven’t been given a key to the door so it’s not actually that much use to us as it stands.

So that’s it for the first instalment of the new house reveal. The upstairs and garden will be featured in the next episode; we don’t want to give you too much of a good thing all in one go now do we??

What’s your favourite “feature” in our new house? What would be your first job? Is there anything that you think might actually stay through to completion?
