In answering the question, it's a bush. It may not look like one give nthat it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and hanging over the fence on both sides but arboreally speaking it is indeed a bush.

I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be two days work for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of Â£1,000. Now, I'm happy to spend money on the house where required but there is no way I'm going to pay someone that much to cut down a bush. This is where the story of Man vs. Bush begins.
