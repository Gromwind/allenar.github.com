In answering the question, it's a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and hanging over the fence on both sides but arboreally speaking it is indeed a bush.

I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be two days work for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of Â£1,000. Now, I'm happy to spend money on the house where required but there is no way I'm going to pay someone that much to cut down a bush. This is where the story of Man vs. Bush begins.

Even though it was only a bush it was a pretty sturdy bush; to the extent that I could actually walk quite a long way out along the branches and it would barely flex. Add a bit of sawing and things started to look up.

After about two evenings elapsed time and four hours of work it might not look like much progress has been made, but what you can see is that there is a fence at the back. When we came and viewed the house you couldn't actually tell what was over the back fence, or even that there was a fence at all!

After making a fairly decent dent to the lower branches and the tops on the left-hand side I had to go overseas for a couple of weeks. Not wanting to lose momentum I hired some labour while I was away... the petrol chipper / shredder did a really good job on the stuff that had been but down and we even managed to reclaim a little bit of the garden. It was short-lived though.

More sawing and plenty of late nights working away with only the light of a head torch to guide me and eventually I got to this.

I'd done a lot of hard work but there was no way I was going to get rid of the body of this bush with a hand saw. It was time to call in the support crew.

Sunday, Dad and a chainsaw. Three things which when combined will take on any bush. I did head from somewhere that it would have been easier with tree fellers, but there was only the two of us available so two fellas it was. I was predominantly on rope duty trying to make sure that we didn't destroy the neighbours fences or sheds in the process and I think we did a good job. I haven't had any complaints so far.

So after reclaiming the garden a couple of weeks ago the bush had once again taken over but this time it would only be temporary and certainly wouldn't be growing.

So we cut down everything that was left, all the way back to the "stump". That was the point at which I was stumped (sorry!). How do you get rid of something this big?!

Do I just keep taking chunks out of it with a chainsaw, do I get some sort of chemicals to try and kill it off with perhaps trying and get some sort of digger in? At this stage I don't how the answer so I've chosen to do option four. Nothing.

Does anyone have any experience removing something of this size? Can  you get stump grinders this big?
