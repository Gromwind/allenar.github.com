In answering the question, it's a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and having over the fences on both sides but arboreally speaking (if that's even a word?!) it is indeed a bush.

I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be a two day job for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of £1,000. Now, I'm happy to spend money on the house where needs be but there is no way I'm going to pay someone a grand to cut down a bush. And so begins Man vs. Bush.

Even though it was only a bush it was a pretty sturdy bush, to the extent that I could actually walk quite a long way out along the branches and it would barely even flex. Add a saw to the equation (albeit a hand saw) and things begin to look up.

After about two evenings and probably four hours of work it might not look like I've made that big a difference, but what you can see is a fence. When we came and viewed the house you couldn't actually tell what was over the back fence, or even that there was a fence at all.
