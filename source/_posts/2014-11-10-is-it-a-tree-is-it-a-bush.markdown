In answering the question, it's a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and having over the fences on both sides but arboreally speaking (if that's even a word?!) it is indeed a bush.

I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be a two day job for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of £1,000. Now, I'm happy to spend money on the house where needs be but there is no way I'm going to pay someone a grand to cut down a bush. And so begins Man vs. Bush.

Even though it was only a bush it was a pretty sturdy bush, to the extent that I could actually walk quite a long way out along the branches and it would barely even flex. Add a saw to the equation (albeit a hand saw) and things begin to look up.

After about two evenings and probably four hours of work it might not look like I've made that big a difference, but what you can see is a fence. When we came and viewed the house you couldn't actually tell what was over the back fence, or even that there was a fence at all.

It may not look that safe, a bloke brandishing a saw precariously perched on the end of a bush branch, but luckily the foreman was regularly on hand to offer direction...

After making a fairly good dent to the lower branches and the tops towards and left-hand side I had to go overseas to work for a couple of weeks. Not wanting to lose momentum I hired some labour while I was away. The petrol chipper / shredder did a really good job on the stuff that had been cut down and we even managed to reclaim a little bit of the garden but it was definitely going to be short-lived.

More sawing and plenty of late nights working away with only the light of a head torch to guide me and eventually I got to this.

I'd done a lot of the hard work but there was no way I was going to get rid of the guts of this bush with a manual saw. It was time to call in support.

Sunday, Dad and Chainsaw. Three things which when combined will make a really big dent in any bush-tree. I was predominantly on rope duty trying to make sure that we didn't destroy neighbours fences or sheds in the process and on the whole I think we did a fairly good job. So after reclaiming the garden a couple of weeks ago the bush had once again taken over it but this time I was just a means to an end.

So we cut down everything that was left, right back to the base. That was the point at which I was really stumped (sorry, it was too good an opportunity to miss!). How do you get rid of a "stump" that is this massive?!

Do I just keep taking chunks out of it with a chainsaw, do I get some sort of chemicals to try and kill it off with or do I convince the neighbours over the back to let me drive a JCB though their garden to dig it out with? At this stage I don't know what the answer is so I chosen to do the fourth option. Nothing.

Does anyone have any experience removing something of this size? Can you get stump grinders this back?
