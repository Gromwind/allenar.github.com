<p>In answering the question, it&rsquo;s a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and having over the fences on both sides but arboreally speaking (if that&rsquo;s even a word?!) it is indeed a bush.</p>

<p>I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be a two day job for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of £1,000. Now, I&rsquo;m happy to spend money on the house where needs be but there is no way I&rsquo;m going to pay someone a grand to cut down a bush. And so begins Man vs. Bush.</p>

<p>Even though it was only a bush it was a pretty sturdy bush, to the extent that I could actually walk quite a long way out along the branches and it would barely even flex. Add a saw to the equation (albeit a hand saw) and things begin to look up.</p>

<p>After about two evenings and probably four hours of work it might not look like I&rsquo;ve made that big a difference, but what you can see is a fence. When we came and viewed the house you couldn&rsquo;t actually tell what was over the back fence, or even that there was a fence at all.</p>

<p>It may not look that safe, a bloke brandishing a saw precariously perched on the end of a bush branch, but luckily the foreman was regularly on hand to offer direction&hellip;</p>

<p>After making a fairly good dent to the lower branches and the tops towards and left-hand side I had to go overseas to work for a couple of weeks. Not wanting to lose momentum I hired some labour while I was away. The petrol chipper / shredder did a really good job on the stuff that had been cut down and we even managed to reclaim a little bit of the garden but it was definitely going to be short-lived.</p>

<p>More sawing and plenty of late nights working away with only the light of a head torch to guide me and eventually I got to this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d done a lot of the hard work but there was no way I was going to get rid of the guts of this bush with a manual saw. It was time to call in support.</p>

<p>Sunday, Dad and Chainsaw. Three things which when combined will make a really big dent in any bush-tree. I was predominantly on rope duty trying to make sure that we didn&rsquo;t destroy neighbours fences or sheds in the process and on the whole I think we did a fairly good job. So after reclaiming the garden a couple of weeks ago the bush had once again taken over it but this time I was just a means to an end.</p>

<p>So we cut down everything that was left, right back to the base. That was the point at which I was really stumped (sorry, it was too good an opportunity to miss!). How do you get rid of a &ldquo;stump&rdquo; that is this massive?!</p>

<p>Do I just keep taking chunks out of it with a chainsaw, do I get some sort of chemicals to try and kill it off with or do I convince the neighbours over the back to let me drive a JCB though their garden to dig it out with? At this stage I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is so I chosen to do the fourth option. Nothing.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience removing something of this size? Can you get stump grinders this back?</p>
