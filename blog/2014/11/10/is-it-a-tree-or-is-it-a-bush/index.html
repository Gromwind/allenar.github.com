<p>In answering the question, it&rsquo;s a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and hanging over the fences on both sides but arboreally speaking it is a bush.</p>

<p>I had a friend who works in the landscaping business come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would be probably be a two day job for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of £1,000. Now, I&rsquo;m happy to spend money on the house where required but there is no way I&rsquo;m going to pa someone that much to cut down a bush. So begins the story of Man vs. Bush.</p>
