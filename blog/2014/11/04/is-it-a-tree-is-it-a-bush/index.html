<p>In answering the question, it&rsquo;s a bush. It may not look like one given that it is absolutely massive, being as tall as the house and having over the fences on both sides but arboreally speaking (if that&rsquo;s even a word?!) it is indeed a bush.</p>

<p>I had a friend who works in the landscaping trade come over and look at it and based on the size of it and lack of rear / side access he guessed that it would probably be a two day job for two guys and cost somewhere in the region of £</p>
